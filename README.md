# Here be Dragons!

This is a (failed) attempt to make [Gnuaccounting](https://www.gnuaccounting.org/) usable on a modern linux system.

I got as far as making it compilable and runnable with Java-17 on openSUSE Leap 15.6. Most of it seems to be working, but the LibreOffice integration is not - on a wayland desktop it crashes, and on X11 the opened LibreOffice window is unusable. I tried to upgrade the underlying noa-libre and the LibreOffice API or SDK or whatever it's called but didn't get it to work.

I'm publishing this here in the hope that someone will pick it up where I left it. Good luck.
